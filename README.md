## Project Overview
This project leverages the customer purchase dataset of AeroFit treadmill models (KP281, KP481, KP781) to understand which customer segments buy which model and why. Using a combination of descriptive statistics, visualisation and probability/contingency-table analysis, the goal is to provide actionable insights for marketing, product positioning and customer targeting.

The interactive dashboard built in Tableau allows stakeholders to explore customer distributions across age, gender, education, income, fitness level, treadmill usage and miles expected per week, in relation to the model purchased.

## 🚀 Business Problem  
AeroFit manufactures three treadmill models: entry-level, mid-level and advanced. The market-research team wants to identify the target audience for each model so they can:  
- tailor marketing campaigns more effectively  
- improve product positioning  
- increase customer uptake of premium models

## The Data

- Product Purchased: KP281, KP481, or KP781
- Age: In years
