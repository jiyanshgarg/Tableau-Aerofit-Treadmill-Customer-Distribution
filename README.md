## Project Overview
This project leverages the customer purchase dataset of AeroFit treadmill models (KP281, KP481, KP781) to understand which customer segments buy which model and why. Using a combination of descriptive statistics, visualisation and probability/contingency-table analysis, the goal is to provide actionable insights for marketing, product positioning and customer targeting.

The interactive dashboard built in Tableau allows stakeholders to explore customer distributions across age, gender, education, income, fitness level, treadmill usage and miles expected per week, in relation to the model purchased.

## The Data
- Product Purchased: KP281, KP481, or KP781
- Age: In years
- Gender: Male/Female
- Education: In years
- Marital Status: Single or partnered
- Usage: How often the treadmill is used weekly
- Income: Annual income (in $)
